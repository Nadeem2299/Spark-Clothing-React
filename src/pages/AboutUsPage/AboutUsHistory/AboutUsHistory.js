        various wholesalers and retailers across India. Bangalore textiles
        industry stands at USD 4.2 billion in 2012 and is globally famous for
        its hosiery products. The City has more than 5,000 garment manufacturing
        units and job work units, and is one of the most organised processing
        and finishing garment clusters in India. The firm came into existence in
        the year 2005 as a Sole Proprietorship concern in Bangalore, Tamil Nadu.
        In the year 2007 it started as family enterprise with a tiny shop
        selling Men’s apparel at much lesser price than market and expanded to
        full men’s wear during next six months. The journey continued and in
